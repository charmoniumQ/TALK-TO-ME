# TALK TO ME!!

## What does this actually do?

It aggregates the things you have said in response to other people,
gives you some statistics, tries to train a chat bot, and crashes.

Maybe eventually, it will not crash.

## Installation instructions

1. Clone the repo.
2. Download your data according to [`talk_to_me/fb_data2exchanges.py:L13`][1].
3. Modify `main.py` to point to your data and your name.
4. Run `main.sh` (It will take care of venv, requirements, etc.).
